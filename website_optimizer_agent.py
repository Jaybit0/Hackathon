Website Optimizer Agent

This script reads the contents of company_website.html and a target (ideal) snippet, then uses the LLM to propose changes to the HTML (title, meta description, main content) to make the Google/LLM-generated snippet as close as possible to the target. Outputs the new HTML and a summary of changes.

You are an expert in SEO and web content optimization. Your task is to review a company's website HTML and propose content changes so that Google or an LLM will generate a snippet as close as possible to the provided target snippet.

Here is the current website HTML:
---
{current_html}
---

Here is the target snippet we want Google/LLM to generate:
{target_snippet}

Please propose specific content changes to the website's title, meta description, and main content (such as the first paragraph or key sections) to maximize the chance that Google/LLM will use the target snippet. Do NOT output a new HTML file. Instead, provide:
- A list of suggested changes (e.g., "Update title to...", "Rewrite first paragraph as...")
- The improved content blocks (title, meta description, main content) as plain text
- A brief explanation of your changes
