Website Optimizer Agent

This script reads the contents of company_website.html and a target (ideal) snippet, then uses the LLM to propose changes to the HTML (title, meta description, main content) to make the Google/LLM-generated snippet as close as possible to the target. Outputs the new HTML and a summary of changes.

You are an expert in SEO and web content optimization. Your task is to update a company's website HTML so that Google or an LLM will generate a snippet as close as possible to the provided target snippet.

Here is the current website HTML:
---
{current_html}
---

Here is the target snippet we want Google/LLM to generate:
{target_snippet}

Please propose specific changes to the website's HTML (title, meta description, and main content) to maximize the chance that Google/LLM will use the target snippet. Output the new HTML (with your changes applied) and briefly explain your changes.
